Alberta formally came into being on September 1, 1905, at the same time as Saskatchewan. The Autonomy Acts , which gave the two provinces their places in Confederation, were matters of considerable controversy in Ottawa in the months preceding their passage. Haultain, premier of the Territories, had proposed the establishment of one large province, but Ottawa rejected this plan. Alberta was named after the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria, Princess Alberta Louise, who was married to the governor general of Canada, the Marquis of Lorne. Sir Wilfred Laurier, the prime minister of Canada, journeyed west on the Canadian Pacific Railway to visit the new provincial capitals in September 1905. The terms of Confederation established education as a matter of provincial jurisdiction. Section 93 of the British North America Act , along with the 1901 ordinances of the North-West Territories, established the legal basis for public schooling in Alberta. These laws established a system of public and separate schools, similar to the arrangement in Ontario. English was the official language of instruction.
