In a typical year, the university has an enrolment of approximately 22,000 undergraduate students and 3,000 graduate students. The university offers over 90 degrees, more than 60 at the undergraduate level, in academic programs as diverse as agricultural and food sciences, music, engineering and medicine. Most of our academic units offer graduate studies programs leading to master's or doctoral degrees. The University of Manitoba is also home to a wide range of research centres and institutes, and Smartpark Research and Technology Park, a community of innovators that forges collaborations between university and industry. The University of Manitoba is Western Canada's first university, founded on February 28, 1877 just seven years after the province of Manitoba and only four years after the City of Winnipeg. At the time, Manitoba was a small postage stamp province, Winnipeg was hardly more than a town and the University of Manitoba was a university in name only, created to confer degrees on students graduating from its three founding colleges – St. Boniface College, St. John's College, and Manitoba College.
