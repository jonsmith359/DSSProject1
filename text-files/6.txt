Charged with high treason for leading the North West Rebellion, Riel wanted to use the trial as a platform to vindicate himself. "I was not taken prisoner. I surrendered on purpose. I want to be judged on the merits of my actions. ... From the time of my arrival in Saskatchewan, I worked peacefully ... We didnt make any aggressive military moves. ... In Batoche we defended ourselves." In turn, the government did all it could to muzzle the Métis leader. It wished to dispose of the man who had led two uprisings in the countrys brief history. The trial was moved from Winnipeg to Regina when the government discovered that a Manitoba jury could be half Métis. Of the six men on the Regina jury - only one spoke French. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to charge Riel with high treason, based on an obscure British law dating to the year 1342. This law carried the death the penalty whereas Canadas treason law did not. Trial began on July 20, 1885. It was a sweltering day made more oppressive by the hordes of people wanting to view the spectacle in Regina.
